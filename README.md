A distributed query processing framework written during my PhD study. Implements a term lexicon, a document dictionary and an inverted index with dynamic pruning and skipping. It supports query evaluation over a term-wise or document-wise partitioned index, with emphasis on pipelined query processing with a term-wise distributed index. The code is shared rather for inspiration and implementations insight than for a further reuse â€“ the implementation was done in a rush, with no unit tests, and there are just too many things I would have done differently today.

Different variants of this code have been used in the following papers:
